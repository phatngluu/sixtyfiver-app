This is the frontend part of vaccine certification system. It connects to Ethereum supported by Metamask and allows users to perform operations like: 
- Medical unit: Register new medical unit and issue vaccine certificate
- Vaccine: import and distribute vaccine to medical units
- End users: register to be vaccinated or view their own certificates.
